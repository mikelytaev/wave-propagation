Key features
============
* Modelling the radio wave propagation over irregular terrain, tropospheric duct and vegetation
* Diffraction over the Earth's surface
* Transparent boundaries modelling via the discrete nonlocal boundary conditions
* Arbitrary operational frequency and transmitting antenna patterns
* Automatic mesh generation and artificial parameters selection: no expert required
* Higher-order discrete and semi-discrete propagator approximations: Pad√© approximation, rational interpolation, Numerov scheme, differential evolution method
* Discrete dispersion relation analysis
* Underwater acoustics: sound propagation over inhomogeneous sound speed profile and irregular bottom
* Multiple knife-edge diffraction problem solver
* Wavenumber integration method
* Python wrappers for PETOOL and RAM
* Greene and Claerbout approximations with linear shift map method
